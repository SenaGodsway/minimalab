 I went through the last
 two weeks of portfolios submitted to my
 discord and I chose eight random ones to
 rank on higher ability, aesthetic, and
 creativity. If you want to get your
 portfolio roasted by the community or
 maybe be featured in one of these
 videos, make sure you join our discord
 and pop it in the portfolio roasting
 channel. All right, Santa is already
 pleased. This looks like a unique
 experience. Hello, I am Angel Gatis. I'm
 bridging the gap between what is and
 what could be. What does that mean?
 Already out of the gate, we have a very
 slow auto typing effect, which doesn't
 tell us anything about who you are. I
 will say I do like the pixel style of
 the site, though. I don't just make
 tools, I make them fight for efficiency.
 Here is my arsenal. Front contend
 framework, React, programming language,
 JavaScript. Look, I'm an engineer and
 I'm like having trouble remembering some
 of these logos. Like, what is Keepa? And
 is this air table or something for
 recruiter? were to land on your site, I
 don't know if they'd have the best time
 knowing what's going on here. All right,
 we go to the first project and it looks
 like the professional category is empty,
 but we have personal and all. If
 personal and all are just going to be
 the same thing and professional is going
 to be empty, maybe just don't have these
 tabs. Okay, so things I don't like about
 this about me page. I don't know where
 you're based in. I actually don't know
 what you do. It's egregiously hard to
 read this because the typography is kind
 of awful. I'm clicking the LinkedIn
 button and it actively does not do
 anything. Pirability, I'm going to give
 this one a five. I feel like Santa
 didn't know enough to hire you as one of
 his elves. God, I'm never saying that
 again. For aesthetic, I'm going to give
 this like an eight. It was like pretty
 cool. Creativity, I'm going to give this
 a nine. All right. Already, I feel like
 there should be one of those like
 seizure warnings or something because
 what in the [ __ ] is going on in the
 background? What in the world is going
 on here, my friend? How is anyone
 supposed to read any of this? Feels like
 one of those sites where like AI added a
 bunch of gradients and like just from a
 bird's eye view, like if you squint hard
 enough where everything blurs together,
 it looks good. But the actual
 readability of this is like quite bad.
 Also, I don't know if these are projects
 or places you've worked. It just says
 collaborations. I don't know what
 collaborations means. I would love to
 actually know like when and how long you
 were at these companies. Also, the
 entire point of like a technologies page
 is to like get a good understanding of
 like what you specialize in. Bros
 Technologies looks just like a sushi
 conveyor belt where he has every single
 thing under the sun listed under here. I
 am never going to be able to understand
 what you actually specialize on. Also,
 some of these are just repeating, so
 it's overwhelming for no reason. Like,
 we have the other category over here,
 but then because it wraps, other is also
 just here again. So, we're seeing like
 double the amount of technologies. It's
 just overwhelming for no reason. Higher
 ability, I'm giving this like a four. I
 feel like I sort of have an idea of what
 you do, but I left the site more
 confused about what you actually
 specialize in than when I joined.
 Aesthetic, probably like a five. And
 creativity, guess like the sushi belt
 conveyor idea was kind of creative. I'll
 probably give this a six. rate this
 portfolio, not mine. Came across this
 portfolio and it seemed clean. I'm
 thinking whether to do something like
 this. Is this like when you go to the
 doctor and you ask about some like
 embarrassing situation and you say your
 friend has it and you're just asking on
 behalf of them. I'm an accomplished
 Marine Corps veteran and senior software
 engineer with Fortune 100 experience.
 I've had a chance to work with highly
 innovative teams including Pixability,
 Google, Amazon Lab. Okay, wait. At first
 when I landed on it, I was like, what is
 going on here? But this is actually a
 pretty decent portfolio in terms of
 hiraability because like in the first
 sentence I get a pretty good idea of
 what this person actually does. Proud of
 leading the UI development for the
 redesign of node.js.dev and constantly
 contributing to open source. This
 portfolio is impressive because this guy
 has a lot of experience and his
 portfolio is just the fastest way to
 convey that information. He literally
 only has one other useful tab here which
 is called resume and it's just a link to
 all the actual things he's done. This is
 a perfect example of what a portfolio is
 meant to be. It is literally meant to
 get across the most impressive part
 about you in a short amount of time. And
 if you have a ton of experience,
 sometimes all you need is a paragraph or
 two just talking about how much of an
 actual track record that you have. Like
 if this guy's resume landed on my desk,
 I would probably consider interviewing
 them. I'm going to give higher ability
 on this like a 9.5. The only thing that
 it's sort of missing is a bit more
 information about like what technologies
 he specializes in. Aesthetic, I'm going
 to give him a six. It's nothing special,
 but it's also not like deterring me from
 reading any of this. Like, I don't mind
 actually reading this because he
 outlines like impressive enough stuff to
 make me want to keep reading. And none
 of it is formatted in a way where it's
 like unreadable like some of the other
 portfolios. In creativity, we're going
 to give this like a three. This next
 portfolio is particularly interesting
 because people in the comments when they
 roasted it said, "This isn't a
 portfolio. It's just a CV." I can tell
 that somebody submits their portfolio
 without watching any of my videos
 because I think in almost every single
 video, my biggest complaint is I do not
 know where the person is based in. The
 top section for your portfolio should
 contain your name, your explicit role,
 some indication of how much experience
 you have and where you are based in
 languages. Okay, we have four distinct
 languages, tools and technologies. Look,
 what I'm about to say is going to come
 off as controversial to a lot of really
 hardcore portfolio enthusiasts, but I
 don't think there is anything wrong with
 simple portfolios like this. Like the
 entire point of a portfolio, if it's
 career oriented, is to put your best
 foot forward and in the shortest amount
 of time get a recruiter to understand
 enough about you to want to hire you.
 Depending on who you are and what you
 have done, that's going to look
 different. Like for people like Ben
 Halverson that have a plethora of like
 really impressive experience, you don't
 need to make some grand impressive
 resume. But also, if you don't have the
 same experience that Ben has, you
 probably shouldn't be making a portfolio
 like him. Similarly, it seems like Pran
 is a technical analyst. He's not like a
 web developer or something that has the
 ability to make fancy UI portfolios and
 he has some realworld experience at
 companies. The whole point of this
 portfolio, if he's applying, is for a
 recruiter to click on it, learn a bit
 more about his experience and what he
 does, and get a more personable
 impression of who he is that you
 wouldn't be able to get from just a
 one-page resume. You know, he has a
 really like likable profile photo going
 on here with that smile. You know, he
 looks like a cutie. I'm like, "Oh man,
 this guy looks like a fun guy to work
 with." If I saw this and I was hiring
 for whatever it is all of this stuff is,
 I would be more willing to want to
 interview him than I would have if I
 just saw his resume. and that's all
 you're trying to get across to people
 and that looks different depending on
 who you are. I don't think there's any
 wrong with this just looking like a CV
 but in a nicer format. I think it got
 the job done. I'm going to give this
 like an eight for higher ability. For
 aesthetic, again, there's nothing there
 that prevents me from being able to read
 it and understand the information on the
 page. I'm going to give it a six.
 Creativity, probably like a four. All
 right, so this guy joined the Discord,
 posted his portfolio, got like a tiny
 bit of feedback, didn't even wait for
 everyone to post it, and then
 immediately left the Discord. Not going
 to lie, I feel used. That alone
 constitutes you being on Santa's naughty
 list. But let's check out his portfolio.
 Right off the bat, this feels very AI
 influenced, but also very newbie
 developerish. I don't think recruiters
 would catch on to this, but if you are a
 developer with experience and you look
 at this portfolio, you can probably see
 exactly what I'm talking about. Like
 number one, we have the light mode, dark
 mode feature. That is like one of the
 first things as a new developer you
 think looks extremely cool on every
 single site. So in your portfolio, be
 like, "Yeah, it'll be a nice touch if I
 add that dark mode, light mode button."
 Like that's what people are looking for
 in top devs. Almost like a right of
 passage that every developer that is
 early on in their journey has to add one
 of these buttons to whatever it is they
 are working on. Also on the top we have
 his name and then just like an A there
 like is this like his logo or something?
 Like you can clearly tell AI added this
 there and he just like I guess it looks
 okay so he just rolled with it. And then
 of course the final telltale sign of
 like a newbie developer is random
 animations just for the sake of having
 it. Like for example, in the background,
 I mostly only see these like DNA floaty
 designs in the background when I ask AI
 to add something in the background to
 make it look more cool. Finally, the on
 hover with the name. Like what purpose
 number one does having your name here a
 second time serve next to its logo when
 you have it right here? But secondly,
 like the hover animation, like what is
 that adding to anything given that this
 person is a full stack developer who
 specializes in React and Nex.js and
 Django. And I promise I'm not just being
 mean cuz he left the discord. But he
 says here a strong attention to detail.
 This is the exact opposite of strong
 attention to detail that I am looking
 for when I look at a developer
 portfolio. When I hire people that are
 going to be working on the front end and
 they talk about pixel perfect design or
 attention to detail and they have all
 this useless stuff that provides
 absolutely no purpose. That is the
 opposite of attention to detail. You are
 cluttering the UI and adding things that
 nobody cares about because you as the
 developer think it's cool. Attention to
 detail is related to user experience,
 not developer experience. You should be
 thinking about what the user wants when
 they land on your site, not what you
 think would look cool. Even the projects
 display, we have five projects here in a
 carousole, but there's a filter projects
 bar. First of all, who's coming on your
 site and they're like, I need a way to
 filter between these five projects. But
 second of all, the filter is on the
 project name itself. Where is the use
 case? There is no user that is going to
 come onto the site know exactly what
 project name they're going to be looking
 for that they wouldn't be able to just
 find by using this carousel and they're
 going to need to like type it in and be
 like, "Oh, I need his nutrition tracker.
 Oh, there it is." It almost feels like
 this portfolio exists more to just be a
 pet project to like learn how to make a
 dark mode light mode button to add
 random animations or more precisely ask
 AI to add random animations and add
 random features to your site than it is
 to actually be hireable or do anything.
 Like one of the biggest things I'm
 looking for is a GitHub button and all I
 have is a button down here that says my
 socials that I have to click to expand.
 There's literally no reason to like have
 to expand this. You can literally just
 show the icons without this button here.
 Overall, higher ability is a two because
 I feel like you talked about things and
 then actively disproved it in your
 portfolio. Aesthetic, I'm going to give
 this like a five and creativity like
 maybe a four. This next portfolio is
 special because it's from one of our
 mods. And not only is he one of our
 mods, but he is one of the most active
 roasters of portfolios in our Discord.
 So, he definitely deserves a review.
 Right off the bat, I'm going to say I'm
 not really a fan of the aesthetic. It
 feels very like 2012esque. Thick white
 borders on dark backgrounds usually
 makes it feel a bit like outdated. It's
 very like old HTMLish style. Ryan Lee,
 full stock developer, Malaysian, but
 based in Australia, fluent in English
 and Mandarin. I already get a good idea
 of who he is and what he does. And we
 have some important links here as well.
 The world is going on [laughter] in your
 Twitch.
 All right. Not going to lie. I think if
 your Twitch is like outdated or like
 you're not like actively streaming. Oh,
 I guess I guess you sort of are
 streaming every now and then. I don't
 know if I put that at the top of your
 portfolio, but either way, it's fine. We
 have a lot of animation here, like this
 line animation that we're finding a lot
 on the site. I don't really think it
 adds anything. In fact, it probably just
 like distracts me from reading the
 important stuff here. But I do like how
 you have your experience, your
 education, and your extracurricular all
 in like an easy to digest manner and
 it's like all upfront. One thing that
 does confuse me is you say you're
 studying, but also you have full stack
 experience as a lead full stack
 developer. Is this like part-time or how
 does that work? Overall for higher
 ability, I'm going to give this an
 eight. I have a good idea of who you
 are. Aesthetic, I'm going to give it
 like a six. I'm not a fan of the style
 of it, but it also wasn't like jarring
 enough to make me not want to read. And
 everything's like tight and concise
 enough for me to get a good
 understanding of who you are without
 having to read paragraphs of jargon. and
 creativity. I'll give it a six. All
 right, right off the bat, it's kind of
 like a cozy vibe. I'm sort of digging
 it. I'm Gregor, a passionate software.
 All right, you already lost me. This is
 the about me section, and all I know
 about you is your name, and then a bunch
 of jargon. I don't know where you're
 based in, what type of stack you
 specialize in or what type of developer
 you are. Okay, we have experienced full
 stack developer doing Flutter, Spring
 Boot, Java Effects, and Magento. I feel
 like when I hear full stack developer,
 I'm thinking full stack web developer,
 but you specifically specialize in
 mobile. Okay, your education technology.
 Wait, what is this? Five out of five.
 Four out of five. This gives me like no
 idea of anything. This is just like when
 people say they're 5 in in JavaScript. I
 don't know what 5 in mean and I don't
 know what four out of five means. Like
 this relative scale is absolutely
 useless. This whole portfolio reads to
 me someone who has like a decent eye for
 like what looks good. Like what is eye
 candy? like the gradients, the text,
 everything feels nice and warm and cozy
 on the site, but nothing [clears throat]
 is what you actually want it to be. I
 know very little about what you actually
 do or how much experience you actually
 have. So, higher ability is like a four
 in terms of aesthetic. Like, it looks
 nice. Like, it's pleasing to my eyes,
 but it was almost a frustrating
 experience because half of it was just
 jargon and not the information I
 actually wanted to see. It's almost like
 you tricked me into like reading things
 cuz I thought it was going to be useful,
 but in reality, it wasn't. So, I'm going
 to give this like a six. In creativity,
 I'll give it like a seven. All right.
 So, right off the bat, this guy has a
 typing animation in like three different
 places, and it causes the entire UI to
 like shift as it's going. Now, I feel
 like I've mentioned in every single one
 of my videos, but this person was like,
 "Can I ask why when someone mentioned
 get rid of the typing animation?" And
 just as a note in our Discord, we have
 an entire portfolio roast FAQ where all
 the advice I have given out in all of
 these videos is nicely organized by one
 of our great mods. I would highly
 recommend checking that out before
 posting your portfolio because otherwise
 you're just posting portfolios like this
 which doesn't follow any of the good
 practices when it comes to portfolios
 and you will get roasted because of it.
 First of all, the colors here and the
 like actual site is insane. I know I
 said one of the previous portfolios
 looked like it was from like 2015, but
 this straight up looks like it's out of
 1995. We have like this thing which I
 assume is trying to be like a light
 toggle or like a light mode toggle, but
 it just does nothing on Switch. So, I
 don't really know what purpose it
 provides. And yeah, we sort of get the
 information we need. Like a Kolkata
 based front-end developer that
 specialized in React Nex.js, Tailwind
 CSS, and Shad CN. I'm going to be real
 with you. Before I read this, I straight
 up thought this whole thing was just
 basic HTML and CSS and you were like a
 back-end developer or something. If you
 are a front-end developer and this is
 like what your portfolio looks like,
 this will make me actively never want to
 hire you. Like I'm kind of in disbelief
 that this is built in Shad Cien and
 Tailwind. Also like small things like
 one of your two projects on the site is
 your portfolio site, but then you have a
 link to it. So when I click it, it just
 takes me back to the portfolio site I'm
 already on. And even like the
 technologies that you say you use for
 the portfolio site, like Zod validation,
 where is ZOD being used here? What is
 coming from Nex.js? Is this like all
 this information coming from like an
 endpoint? That it it doesn't even make
 sense. This is unique because we've
 never had somebody submit their
 portfolio, but also have their portfolio
 on their portfolio with a description of
 how they view their own portfolio. It
 delivers a minimalist yet sophisticated
 aesthetic with a comprehensive light
 dark mode system. Fluid animations
 powered by frame motion and optimized
 layouts to ensure a seamless user
 experience across all devices. Like
 Santa's not trying to be mean here or
 anything, but I really hope AI wrote
 this because if this is how you view
 your portfolio, that it delivers a
 minimalist minimalist yet sophisticated
 aesthetic. I think you should go through
 and watch almost every single one of my
 portfolio videos and go through all of
 the portfolios on this spreadsheet
 because I don't think you have a good
 enough frame of reference, not just on
 portfolios, but like how web experiences
 work from like websites in general. I'm
 going to give this a one on higher
 ability, a one on aesthetic, and maybe
 like a five for creativity. If you want
 to submit your portfolio, all you have
 to do is join our Discord. Link is in
 the description, and you can submit it
 there. But more importantly, if you
 actually want to build taste and the eye
 for what a good portfolio looks like,
 the best way to do that is by roasting
 other people's portfolios. So, by
 joining our Discord, you can do that as
 well. Let me know if you want me to keep
 doing these videos, which portfolio was
 your favorite, what you found funny, and
 make sure you hit that subscribe button.
 and I'll see you guys in the next video.
